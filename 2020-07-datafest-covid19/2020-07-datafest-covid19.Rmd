[INTRODUCTION]

## DataFest: COVID-19 Virtual Data Challenge {-}

[The American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/) is a data analysis competition where teams of up to five students analyze a real and complex dataset over the course of one weekend. In 2019, DataFest was held at over 40 locations in the United States and internationally with more than 2000 students participating in the event. The surprise data set is revealed to participants at the kick-off event on Friday afternoon, and students work throughout the weekend analyzing the data and deriving insights. On Sunday afternoon, the groups present their work to a panel of judges made up of instructors and data science professionals in industry. By the end of the DataFest weekend, students have not only gained experience analyzing real-world data, they have also practiced presentation skills, all while connecting with other students, faculty members, and industry professionals.

In March 2020 as many colleges and universities transitioned to a remote format, the DataFest steering committee considered alternatives for this year's competition. The goal was to adapt DataFest to the new environment, yet still include the parts of the event that make it an inviting and valuable experience for students all students with a wide range of statistics and data analysis experience. The 2020 DataFest was a virtual data challenge where students worked in teams to explore an impact of COVID-19 global pandemic. Given the variety of potential topics, part of what made this year's challenge unique was that it involved participants finding a data set for their analysis.

DataFest events were held in April - June, a time when data and modeling about the direct health outcomes of the pandemic was rapidly changing and unreliable. Building models and drawing reliable conclusions about infection, mortality, or recovery rates require understanding the nuances and limitations of the COVID-19 health data at the level of someone with training in epidemiology. Therefore, participants were advised to “tell us about something affected by the COVID-19 pandemic other than its direct health outcomes”, to discourage them from presenting conclusions that could be potentially misleading or harmful. 

- Suggested analysis questions: 
  - How has the pandemic affected the airline industry and what are some potential downstream effects of this other than economic strain on the industry?
  - As a student, how would you quantify the effect of the pandemic on your education?
  - With shelter in place / lockdown in place, many workers have started working from home, which requires internet access. How prepared was the nation / your local area for this shift?
  - How has the spread of the pandemic affected people’s opinion on government tracking and privacy?
  - What is the effect of the social distancing / shelter in place / lockdown recommendations and policies on pollution?
  - How can we quantify the potential effects on nutrition and general health of the public, outside of those affected by the virus?
How are refugees affected by COVID-19?
- Examples of students' data sets and analysis questions? 
- Description of some of the winning projects?

## Using COVID-19 data in the classroom {-} 

At the May 2020 Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics (eCOTS), Laura Le, Kari Lock Morgan, and Lucy McGowan presented [Engaging Students during the COVID-19 Health Crisis](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots20/panels/2) about how to incorporate data related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the classroom. The primary focus was that the pedagogy should be "trauma-informed" due to the pandemic's direct impact on students. By taking this trauma-informed approach instructors can create a classroom environment where students feel safe to discuss the subject and reduce risk of retraumatizing students impacted by the pandemic^[Abuelezam, N, (2020). *Teaching Public Health Will Never Be the Same*. American Journal of PUblic Health, 110(7), 976-977. https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305710]

The panelists shared practical ways instructors can use a trauma-informed approach when discussing data related to the pandemic in class:

  - Anonymously poll students about whether or not they want to talk about the data related to COVID-19 in class. It is a good idea to poll multiple times to get point-in-time feedback, since students' feelings may change as the situation around the pandemic evolves.
  - Indicate in the syllabus when COVID-19 data will be used, so students know when the topic will come up in class.
  - Create an alternative assignment or discussion prompt for students who do not wish to discuss the pandemic.
  - If the course is designed to a more specialized audience, such as a biostatistics or graduate-level course, the instructor can address the fact that the topic is sensitive but is also an important area of research in biostatistics. This is also an opportunity for the instructor to talk about strategies for maintaining a healthy relationship with emotions when doing research on sensitive topics.
  - As with this year's DataFest, the analysis examples can focus on societal impacts of the pandemic other than direct health outcomes.
