COVID-19 has undoubtedly generated a plethora of data, from daily counts on tests, positive results, hospitalisations, deaths, etc. to data from scientific studies on the virus and treatment to data on the impact of the pandemic on the economy, education, mental health, etc. 
Engaging statistics and data science students with these data seems obvious, but the decision of whether to bring COVID-19 data into the statistics and data science classrooms is not simple. 
On one hand, the answer might seem like an obvious *yes* -- what better way to engage students with real data than data about the pandemic that has turned all of our lives upside down. 
On the other hand, at least at the time of writing this column, we're still in the midst of a pandemic that has taken many lives and, indeed, turned all of our lives upside down, which might be the very reason to to say *no* to bringing these data into the classroom. 

In this column we showcase a few approaches for bringing COVID-19 data into our teaching as well as highlight resources that might help you decide whether to do so in the first place. 

## DataFest: COVID-19 Virtual Data Challenge {-}

[The American Statistical Association (ASA) DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/) is a data analysis competition where teams of up to five students analyze a real and complex dataset over the course of one weekend. In 2019, DataFest was held at over 40 locations in the United States and internationally with more than 2000 students participating in the event. The surprise data set is revealed to participants at the kick-off event on Friday afternoon, and students work throughout the weekend analyzing the data and deriving insights. On Sunday afternoon, the groups present their work to a panel of judges made up of instructors and data science professionals in industry. By the end of the DataFest weekend, students have not only gained experience analyzing real data, they have also practiced presentation skills, all while connecting with other students, faculty members, and industry professionals.

In March 2020 as many colleges and universities transitioned to a remote format, the ASA DataFest steering committee considered alternatives for this year's competition. The goal was to adapt ASA DataFest to the new environment, yet still include the parts of the event that make it an inviting and valuable experience for students all students with a wide range of statistics and data analysis experience. The 2020 ASA DataFest ran as a virtual data challenge where students worked in teams to explore an impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Given the variety of potential topics, part of what made this year's challenge unique was that it involved participants finding a data set for their analysis.

DataFest events were held in April through June, a time when data and modeling about the direct health outcomes of the pandemic was rapidly changing and unreliable (see [*Why It’s So Freaking Hard To Make A Good COVID-19 Model*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/)). Building models and drawing reliable conclusions about infection, mortality, or recovery rates require understanding the nuances and limitations of the COVID-19 health data at a level that would likely not be feasible in the short span of the DataFest competition. Therefore, participants were advised to “tell us about something affected by the COVID-19 pandemic other than its direct health outcomes”, to discourage them from presenting conclusions that could be potentially misleading or harmful. 

A few suggested analysis questions included the following:

- How has the pandemic affected the airline industry and what are some potential downstream effects of this other than economic strain on the industry?
 - As a student, how would you quantify the effect of the pandemic on your education?
- With shelter in place / lockdown orders, many workers have started working from home, which requires internet access. How prepared was the nation / your local area for this shift?
- How has the spread of the pandemic affected people’s opinion on government tracking and privacy?
- What is the effect of the social distancing / shelter in place / lockdown recommendations and policies on pollution?
- How can we quantify the potential effects on nutrition and general health of the public, outside of those affected by the virus?
- How are refugees affected by COVID-19?

When we suggested these potential analysis questions to students we were worried that we might be giving too much direction and curbing their creativity. 
Fortunately, this was not the case, and students who participated in the event chose a wide variety of questions. 
We provide below a sample of analysis foci from the winning teams that we hope might be inspirational for educators wanting to bring COVID-19 data into their classrooms.

- Societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on education in the United States: Analysis of data from surveys conducted by the US Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, examining the availability of devices and internet in households with children in public or private schools in the US over a period of four weeks, 23 April - 26 May 2020. (The Data Quails - University of Edinburgh)

- Relationship between dengue fever outbreak and lockdown: Investigation of whether the dengue fever outbreak in Singapore, which coincided with Circuit Breaker (Singapore's COVID-19 lockdown measures), could be attributed to the Circuit Breaker, or alternatively if the Circuit Breaker had worsened the dengue fever outbreak. (Team lemonchocolatecheesecake - University of Edinburgh)

- Dreams in the time of COVID-19: Exploration of Google search trends as well as sentiment analysis of tweets related to people having vivid dreams during COVID-19 outbreak. (Apoorv Jha - Duke University)

- How research priorities shift as COVID-19 Progresses: Exploration of the dataset provided as part of Kaggle's COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) suggesting that research focus shifted from finding a cure to preventative measures for containing COVID-19. (Team N & N - Duke University)

- Purchasing behavior via Amazon and Google Trends: Analysis of purchasing behavior data based on Amazon prices and Google Trends. (Team Maskman - UCLA)

- Driving during quarantine: Investigation of traffic data to evaluate the effectiveness of the call for social distancing in Toronto measured by the decrease in the amount of people driving in residential areas of the city. (Team Shirley Eva - University of Toronto)

The variety in these projects signal the feasibility of engaging students with COVID-19 data without the need for epidemiological modeling expertise. 
We should also note that almost many submissions for ASA DataFest used data provided openly by governments, suggesting that featuring COVID-19 related data in classes might also be a good way to expose students to open government datasets. 


## Using COVID-19 data in the classroom {-} 

At the May 2020 Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics (eCOTS), Laura Le, Kari Lock Morgan, and Lucy McGowan presented [Engaging Students during the COVID-19 Health Crisis](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots20/panels/2) about how to incorporate data related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the classroom. The primary focus was that the pedagogy should be "trauma-informed" due to the direct impact on students. By taking this trauma-informed approach instructors can create a classroom environment where students feel safe to discuss the subject and reduce risk of retraumatizing students impacted by the pandemic.

The panelists shared practical ways instructors can use a trauma-informed approach when discussing data related to the pandemic in class:

  - Anonymously poll students about whether or not they want to talk about the data related to COVID-19 in class. It is a good idea to poll multiple times to get point-in-time feedback, since students' feelings may change as the situation around the pandemic evolves.
  - Indicate in the syllabus when COVID-19 data will be used, so students know when the topic will come up in class.
  - Create an alternative assignment or discussion prompt for students who do not wish to discuss the pandemic.
  - If the course is designed to a more specialized audience, such as a biostatistics or graduate-level course, the instructor can address the fact that the topic is sensitive but is also an important area of research in biostatistics. This is also an opportunity for the instructor to talk about strategies for maintaining a healthy relationship with emotions when doing research on sensitive topics.
  - As with this year's DataFest, the analysis examples can focus on societal impacts of the pandemic other than direct health outcomes.

Kari Lock Morgan suggests to add caveats when we discuss this data that we are not experts, have not done an exhaustive literature review and can't vouch for everyone's models and predictions. 

## Activity: Visualizing the effects of the pandemic {-}

The primary goals of this exercise are for students to discuss and understand the elements of an effective data visualization and the ethical considerations when working with sensitive and continuing developing data. This exercise is largely inspired by the following data analysis exercises: [Dangerous Numbers? Teaching About Data and Statistics Using the Coronavirus Outbreak](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/learning/dangerous-numbers-teaching-about-data-and-statistics-using-the-coronavirus-outbreak.html), [Visualizing COVID-19](https://rpruim.github.io/ds303/S20/hw/covid-19/covid-19.html)
, and [Cumulative deaths from COVID-19]( https://rstudio.cloud/project/1444789). Though these three activities largely deal with the direct-health outcomes, the exercise described below could be used with any data related to the pandemic.  See examples of other datasets related to the pandemic [here](https://coronavirus-teaching-resources.netlify.app/tags/alternative-data/) 

### Part 1: Critique existing visualizations {-}

Since the beginning of the pandemic, there have been a variety of data visualizations used by government organizations, news media, and the public outlets to help the general public better understand the pandemic (e.g. the "flattening the curve" charts). This has resulted in a collection of examples that can be used to help students think about how visualizations can be used tos
effectively (and sometimes effectively) communicate insights gleaned from complex data to the public. This creates a valuable learning opportunity that can help students develop their statistical literacy. It also helps students connect and immediately apply what they're learning in a real-world context, where they can contribute to current conversations in society. 

The first part of the activity is to get students thinking about the principles of data ethics and ethical data visualizations. As data is being in used in almost every area of society, it is important that students learn how principles for analyzing and interpreting data in a ethical way. The 2016 *GAISE* report^[American Statistical Association, 2016. Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) College Report, Alexandria: American Statistical Association.] includes "demonstrate an awareness of ethical issues associated with sound statistical practice." The textbook [Modern Data Science with R](https://mdsr-book.github.io/excerpts/mdsr-ethics.pdf)^[Baumer, B., Kaplan, D., and Horton, N., 2017.*Modern Data Science with R*. CRC Press.] has a chapter dedicated to ethical data science practices and professional ethics. More specific to this activity, the post [*Ethical Data Viz*](https://teachdatascience.com/ethicaldataviz/)^[Hardin, J., 2020. Ethical Data Viz. [online] Teach Data Science. Available at: <https://teachdatascience.com/ethicaldataviz/> [Accessed 9 July 2020].] on the Teach Data Science includes examples of ineffective and misleading data visualizations and some considerations to make when creating visualizations. Lastly, the post [*Ten Considerations Before You Create Another Chart About COVID-19*](https://medium.com/nightingale/ten-considerations-before-you-create-another-chart-about-covid-19-27d3bd691be8)^[Makulec, A., 2020. Ten Considerations Before You Create Another Chart About COVID-19. [online] Nightingale. Available at: <https://medium.com/nightingale/ten-considerations-before-you-create-another-chart-about-covid-19-27d3bd691be8> [Accessed 8 July 2020].] provides a list of criteria to consider for visualizations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Have students examine a visualization that conveys information about an impact of the pandemic. Using the resources above as a foundation, students can write or discuss their responses to the following: 

> _**Q1.** What is the topic of the visualization? What is its primary message?_

> _**Q2.** In what ways is it effective? In what ways is it ineffective or even misleading?_

> _**Q3.** (If an interactive visualization) What are the benefits of displaying the data using an interactive visualization? What are the limitations?_ 

> _**Q4.** How can you improve the existing visualization or display the data in a new way?_

[TO DO: PLACES TO FIND VISUALIZATION? ]

### Part 2: Your turn! {-}

Once students have had a chance to examine existing visualizations, it's their turn to create their own! Taking the principles from Part 1, students can create their own visualization replicate an existing one as shown in [I Eat Data Science for Breakfast: pandemic 2020 edition](https://learn.themethodsection.com/workshops/ieat/pandemic2020/) workshop. Students replicating an existing visualization can take on the additional challenge of trying to improve it. Additionally, students include a short write up that includes a description of the data, the primary message, some interesting findings, and ideas to continually improve the visualization. 

Students can share their work in a platform shared by the class, such as a discussion forum in the course learning management system. In the Visualizing COVID-19 activity, Randy Prium had students add their code to a class repository on GitHub and paste their plot and write up in a Google doc shared by the class. The gallery of student work provides another opportunity for discussion about the the decisions they made while completing the assignment and the challenges of working with complex real-world data. 

Take it step further and have students look at data organization on GitHub and pulling data from other sources (from the [Visualizing COVID-19](https://rpruim.github.io/ds303/S20/hw/covid-19/covid-19.html))

## Conclusion 

In this column we shared how we used this year's DataFest to give students an opportunity to explore societal impacts of the pandemic, some considerations when using data related to the pandemic in the classroom, and an example classroom activity.
