[INTRODUCTION]

## DataFest: COVID-19 Virtual Data Challenge {-}

- Description of [ASA DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/)
- Changes to this year's competition format due to COVID-19
- Examples of students' data sets and analysis questions? 
- Description of some of the winning projects? 
- Why students were encouraged to explore societal impacts rather than direct health outcomes
  - [*Why Itâ€™s So Freaking Hard To Make A Good COVID-19 Model*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/)

## Using COVID-19 data in the classroom {-}

- eCOTS panel: [Engaging Students during the COVID-19 Health Crisis](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots20/panels/2) discussed considerations for using COVID-19 data in the classroom. 

- Pedagogy must be "trauma informed"
  - Poll students to ask if they want to talk about COVID. Get repeated feedback at that point in time, because their feelings may change. 
  - Put a marker in the syllabus, so students know when the topic come up.
  - Discuss other impacts besides direct health outcomes. 
  - Create option for students who find topic too upsetting.
  - Address the fact that the topic is sensitive to some but is an important area of research in biostatistics. Talk about how to approach data and have a healthy relationship with emotions when doing research on sensitive topics (primarily for graduate students).

- Other resources for teaching about COVID or sensitive topics? 

## Examples for the classroom {-}

- Include some examples of data sets / articles and discussion questions for class?
