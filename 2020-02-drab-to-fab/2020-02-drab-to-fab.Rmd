In our September 2014 column titled we wrote about five concrete reasons your students should be learning to analyze data in the reproducible paradigm. 
One of the reasons we gave was that ``[t]his workflow establishes the norm that data analysis and science in general should be an iterative process". 
Just like data analysis in general, creating an effective data visualisation is also an interative process. 

[TODO: Better link between two paragraphs]

It can be very inspirational to share highly polished data visualisations with students. 
A few of our favourite visualisations to bring to the classroom are text analysis of Donald Trump's tweets by David Robinbson ([varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/)), the Dialect Survey by Joshua Katz ([joshkatz.co/dialect.html](http://joshkatz.co/dialect.html)), and map of America's weather related disasters by Tim Meko ([washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/mapping-disasters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/mapping-disasters)). 
We also love the NY Times series What's Going on in This Graph? ([nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph](https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph)) as well as just about any visualisation from the Flowing Data blog by Nathan Yau ([flowingdata.com](https://flowingdata.com/)), The Pudding ([pudding.cool](https://pudding.cool/)) and The Functional Art blog by Alberto Cairo ([thefunctionalart.com](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/)). 
For example, the stories on how the American work day changed over 15 years ([flowingdata.com/2019/07/16/how-the-american-work-day-changed-in-15-years](https://flowingdata.com/2019/07/16/how-the-american-work-day-changed-in-15-years)) and on gender tropes in film with screen direction ([pudding.cool/2017/08/screen-direction](https://pudding.cool/2017/08/screen-direction)) both feature in-depth and enlightening but simple visualisations that tell a meaningful story. 
We like these examples because their message is clear enough to glean quickly, but one can extract deeper insights by looking at them for a bit longer, a bit more closely.

All of these visualisations share one thing in common -- they are incredibly polished. 
It is possible for a student just starting off to think "well, I could never do that!". 
Or perhaps worse, to think that they can, and not get to something as impressive on their first or second try and get discouraged. 
We believe that it's important to show students not only the end result, but also the process of building a meaningful data visualisation. 
This journey can be incredibly educational in its own, as each step of the improvement is an opportunity to teach a new data visualisation or wrangling technique. 
In this column we walk through one such example. 

## The drab {-}

The data come from The American Association of University Professors (AAUP), which is a nonprofit membership association of faculty and other academic professionals. 
In 2013, the AAUP published a report on Trends in Instructional Staff Employment Status, which includes a visualisation that looks like the following.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Reproduction of visualisation included in the 2013 AAUP report on titled Trends in Instructional Staff Employment Status"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/staff-employment.png")
```

The visualisation is a bit difficult to make sense of, and this is the point. 
We show this visualisation to the students at the beginning of the class, with some clarification on what the y-axis means (various levels of staff at the university who teach classes, ranging from graduate students to full-time tenured faculty) and ask them to interpret the visualisation in teams. 
Eventually students are able to identify the main message of the story: the highest proportion of instructors are part-time faculty, and this proportion has been increasing from 1975 to 2011. 
Along with this main message, students also naturally come to the conclusion that this is not the best visualisation of these data, and in fact, the visualisation hides the main message instead of making it loud and clear.

At this point it's a worthwhile exercise to ask students to start thinking about how this visualisation can be improved. 
Instead of just talking through it, we ask students to sketch the visualisations on a piece of paper. 
They're not expected to actually create an accurate visualisation via a sketch, but we recommend they label their axes, mark their axis ranges, and decide on which geometric object(s) they plan on using to represent their data (points, lines, bars, etc.).
Having though through this, and especially having put it down on paper with a sketch, gives the students a path to follow in the next step when they're using software to build this visualisation.

## Onto the fab {-}

Next is improving this visualisation. 
One can do this as a class exercise, with interactive exercises and just-in-time teaching sprinkled in, or give it as an assignment students work on outside of class. 
For the latter, we have had a great experience with assigning this as a team exercise. 
If the class size allows, it's also a great idea to then have students present their process (both technical and thought processes) for improving so that they can see the various approaches each team takes.

Next we walk through a possible path to "fab" (an improved visualisation), highlighting opportunities for instruction along the way. We also present a series of questions for discussion.

### Step 1. Get the data {-}

The dataset provided in the report is in the following format.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
staff_wide <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
staff_wide %>% kable()
```

1. What does each row represent in the dataset? What does each column represent? What do the numbers represent? What does each column add up to, and why?

### Step 2. Reshape the data {-}

[TO DO: SOME LANGUAGE AROUND WE NEED PERCENTAGES TO BE IN A COLUMN]

```{r}
staff_long <- staff_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "percentage") %>%
  mutate(percentage = as.numeric(percentage))

staff_long %>%
  print(n = 5)
```

### Step 3. Recreate the plot {-}

We reordered the graph, so one can more easily make comparisons of the percentage of faculty at each level in a given year. This is often a first step for recreating the graph, but still something is not right...

- How is this plot an improvement on the original? 
- What about this plot still makes the primary message hidden?

```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  coord_flip()
```

This is much better...

```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  coord_flip()
```

### Step 4. Improve the plot {-}

This tells the story even better...

- How is this an imporvement on the previous plot? 
- What is an advantage of using a segmented barplot rather than side-by-sided bars as in the previous iteration? 
- How can we improve this plot further to make the primary message even clearer? 

```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = faculty_type)) +
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip()
```

But lines would be better...

```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, group = faculty_type, 
             color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
```

The lines are an improvement over the bars, but notice the x-axis. Because `year` was originally stored as categorical data, the years are equally spaced in the plot, giving the impression that the data were collected at equally spaced time intevals. 
Let's fix this, so it is clear to the reader the intervals at which the data were collected.

Talk about the axes, ...Need to make year numeric, so the axes are in time order. Add points to the plots, so you can see the years where there's data.

```{r}
staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage, group = faculty_type, 
             color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  geom_line()
```

And we can take it even one step further...


```{r}
staff_long %>%
  mutate(part_time = if_else(faculty_type == "Part-Time Faculty", "Part-Time Faculty", "Other Faculty")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage/100, group = faculty_type, 
             color = part_time)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "red"))
```

Now we've focused in on one primary message: the increase in part-time faculty over time. By making the lines for the other faculty levels gray, we can still see the trends at those levels; however, they do not distract from the primary level of interest - part time faculty. Now the reader can get one clear message from the plot after only a few moments of examination. 

### Step 5. Pushing it a bit more {-}

```{r}
staff_long %>%
  mutate(part_time = if_else(faculty_type == "Part-Time Faculty", "Part-Time Faculty", "Other Faculty")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percentage/100, group = faculty_type, 
             color = part_time)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "red")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Instructional staff employment trends",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Percentage",
    color = ""
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
